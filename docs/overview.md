# Twitter Streaming Anlysis

Author: Jonathan Nocek

## Overview

I want to create a analytics dashboard to provide analysis about the 2020 Presidential Race using Twitter. The will be to use the Twitter API to stream data in Realtime using AWS Kinesis. The data will stored within AWS and a dashboard will created. The dashboard would potentially trach the mentions of the candidates and classify them into the positive and negative mentions. I could also use the data and machine learning to classify whether a state will vote Republican or Democrat in the 2020 Election based on the data.
