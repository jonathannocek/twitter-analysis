# Presentation 2: Week of January 26th

## Current State

This week, I was able to do some additional data cleaning on the initial json file. Now, I am passing the
following variables into Kibana: username, tweet, city, state, sentiment, datatime, score. I was able to stream
tweets containing 'Trump' and learned that there were approximately 10 tweets per 30 seconds on Friday night.
