# Twitter Analysis: Creating a real time data pipeline to analyze Twitter data

Author: Jonathan Nocek

## Overview

This project aims to provide real time information from Twitter about what is happening now. Through Tweepy and various services from Amazon Web Services, tweets are streamed, sent through a data pipeline, and finally visualized using a Kibana dashboard. 

## Background

This is a project for DS395 at Illinois Wesleyan University during the 2020 Spring semester. This course finishes the Data Science minor by having students do a independent study Capstone project that will be presented during the John Wesley Powell conference at the end of the semester. This project aims to provide analysis around the 2020 Democratic primaries and General Election.
